## Technical Projects

Below is a selection of software projects I have developed, showcasing my expertise in mobile application development, web development, and browser extension technologies:

- **[SplitX](https://www.splitx.org)**: A comprehensive mobile application designed for expense management and bill splitting among groups. The application enables users to record transactions seamlessly and automatically calculate fair distribution of shared expenses, streamlining financial management for teams and social groups.

- **[Timepass Websites](https://timepasswebsites.lol/)**: A curated collection of innovative web applications and digital tools sourced from developers worldwide. This platform serves as a discovery hub for unique digital experiences and showcases cutting-edge web development trends and creative implementations.

- **[Bookmark of the Day](https://www.bookmarkoftheday.xyz/)**: A Chrome browser extension that revolutionizes bookmark management through intelligent automation. The extension helps users rediscover and organize their saved content by presenting daily bookmark suggestions, enhancing productivity and information retrieval workflows.
